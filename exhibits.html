 <img src="img/oldspies.jpg" alt="Old Spies">
    <p>When spies need to plant a bug, secretly snap a photo, communicate covertly, or don a disguise, they turn to Technical Operations or Tech Ops. Meet the inventors, engineers, scientists, computer whizzes, artists, and tinkerers who fuse imagination and technical know-how to create the devices agents and handlers need to overcome challenges in the field.</p>
    <p>The gadgets featured in this exhibit cover five key areas: covert communications, surveillance and counter-surveillance, escape and evasion, disguise, and secret entry.</p>

 <img src="img/olddocument.jpg" alt="Old Document">
    <p>Some places are too dangerous or remote to send in spies. Some information is beyond the reach of human senses. That’s when scientists, engineers, IT specialists, and researchers must devise innovative solutions—new ways to intercept messages, conduct surveillance, or sniff out secrets. Featured: Signals Intel (SIGINT), Imagery Intel (IMINT), Measures & Signature Intel (MASINT) and Open Source Intel (OSINT).</p>

        <h2>4TH FLOOR</h2>
    </div>
    <p>How do spy agencies protect against threats at home? What happens when they go too far? Delve into spy tales from Renaissance Venice to Cold War Berlin.</p>
    <p>All countries experience threats—real, perceived, or contrived. But how do they respond to these threats? This gallery explores these responses—from interrogation to surveillance. How much protection is enough? How much is too much? The answer can be the difference between citizens living in security or living in an oppressive security state. Explore this uncertain world.</p>
    <h3>TURNCOATS & TRAITORS</h3>
    <p>What happens when intelligence insiders pose a threat to their own countries’ interests? Hear about some of the 20th century’s most notorious traitors: the US’ Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, and John Walker, Britain’s Kim Philby/Cambridge Five, and the Soviet Union’s Adolf Tolkachev. Discover how these men were caught—or not caught.</p>
    <img src="img/yellowfloor.jpg" alt="Yellow Floor">
    <h3>CONFRONTING TERRORISTS</h3>
    <p>Terrorism is not a new threat. Countries around the world have experienced terrorism where we live (the Palmer Raids of the 1920s), work (the 1995 Oklahoma bombing), and play (the 1972 Munich Olympics).
